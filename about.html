                    <p><font color="red"> Introduction :

       My name is Samir Eldahan and soccer is my love. Soccer is basically my life. I have played soccer since I was 4 years old. I played for Pleasant View school during my elementary and middle school year. Went to Bartlett and played soccer there for 4 years. I have recently committed to Lipscomb University in the NCAA Division 1 level. 
Family : 

      My family consists of 6 members including me. I have my father, mother, two brothers, and 1 sister. I love my family very dearly. They mean the world to me and they are the reasons why I keep trying to excel in what I love to do. My parents are both not from America. My mom is From Morocco and my Dad is from Egypt. We have a Mediterranean Grocery store down on Houston Levee. You should come and try the food it is pretty good. 

Where I see myself: 
      
     In 5 years I see myself playing in the MLS after the draft my senior year in college. I'll try to get on there earlier. Then after a few years in MLS I'll get traded to some Premier League Team. </font></p>
